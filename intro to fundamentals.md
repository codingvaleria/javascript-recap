# Basic JavaScript Syntax
- Js is case-sensitive

# Naming conventions
- all variables begin with either a letter, a dollar sign or an underscore
- variable names can contain letters or numbers but not special characters or keywords

- variables cannot be declared with keywords

- variable identifiers are case sensitive

# Casing
- camelCasing

# Variables
- is an area in computer memory storing and retrieve information from.

- declared with; 
    var ; 
    let ; - declare once , but assign as many times
    const ; to express the variable will never change 

# Initialization
- its important to inialise at the point of declaration


# Data Types
    - to check use typeof 
 ### Primitive ; simple/basic - hold single data
    1. Number i.e no floats or integer
    2. String - text values
    3. Boolean - only true or false
    4. undefined -declares a variable that has not been assigned a value to it
    5. Null - value is not there
    6. Symbol - is a unique value ; is an identifier for object properties.
    7. BigInt - for big numbers, add letter n end of number to have a big number

### Non- primitive - complex - hold multiple data
    8. Object(arrays,functions and objects)
    
    
# Type conversion & Coercion
- Conversion Refers to converting variables to a different data type
- Coercion refers to joining two data types, so one is changes to a different one so the output is similar

all data types are truthy except for number 0, null and undefined.

using the + and - javasript assumes what you are supposed to do and it does the expected operation which is a bad trait as it leads to bugs

# Arithmetic Operators
- These are calculations

# Relational operators
- used to compare different values
 - Output is a boolean value

 1. greater than >
 2. Less than <
 3. less than or equal to <= 
 4. Greater than or equal to >= 
 5. Equal to ==
 6. Strictly equal to ===
 
 # Logical Operators
 1. AND (&&) - true if both are true
 2. OR (||) - true if either is true
 3. NOT (!) - reverses logic
